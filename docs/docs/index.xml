      <description>You&#39;re in the workshop right now! Enjoy! Learn!  GANs 1: Exercises in the workshop These are the exercises provided for the Workshop on GANs
Implementation of a GAN:
 Simple Gaussian MNIST GAN  Dimitri&amp;rsquo;s serious stuff:
 Exercises Experiments  Showcase, other experiments:
 Multi-dataset GAN  We hope you have a good experience. Good luck.
GANs 2 Theory slides Here you have the slides.
Exercise notebooks These are the notebooks we will use during the second workshop on GANs.</description>

      <description>Warning, this page is a work in progress.
 Introduction to GANs This is a brief explanation of the Gaussian GAN example done during the workshop.
If you want to jump stright to the code you can find it here
take me to the code  GANs are a type of generative models. That means that they try to learn the probability distribution of a dataset so they can can create new instances that look like the ones in the dataset.</description>
